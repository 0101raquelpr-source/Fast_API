I have built a robust web API using Python and the FastAPI framework to manage a movie database. 
It features secure user authentication with JWT for login and registration, and uses SQLModel to interact with the database. 
This project is highly scalable and can easily be expanded to include more complex features, protect more endpoints with role-based access, 
and be deployed to a production environment using a powerful database like PostgreSQL.
